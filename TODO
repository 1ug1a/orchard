Todo list!

This is so that I can look back at this and motivate myself by seeing the work
I've already done.

x: done
.: in progress
 : not done

Orchard back-end:
[x] Come up with the conceptual design
[x] Create database schema in SQL
[x] Set up PostgREST and test it out with some queries against the database
    with mock data
[x] Determine the interface for "drivers" which interface against Discord,
    Steam workshop etc.
[x] Implement a stubbed driver for writing code against.
[x] Set up an IPFS node
[x] Switch vitals over to hosting files on IPFS instead of imgur freeloading
[.] Write code that uses a driver and generates PostgREST queries.
[ ] Implement "what levels are stale?" (need to be updated) in SQL
[ ] Modify the generator to only generate newly added levels
[ ] Modify the generator to delete levels when they are removed from the
    source
[ ] Decide on how we're going to do search
[ ] Implement search, filtering, sorting, etc.
[ ] Implement booster packs, hopefully in SQL directly
[ ] Finalise initial API
[ ] Create Docker image ready for deployment

Orchard front-end:
[x] I want to do something skeumorphic but with pixel art
[ ] Research ideas + mockups, get a discussion going on RDL
[ ] Hire someone on RDL to do pixel art assets. Maybe multiple people?
[ ] Make it! Probably React + Tailwind

Discord bot:
[ ] Look at cheap storage systems for discord bots instead of Sheets or Firestore
[ ] (Geez firestore is annoying as hell)
[ ] Check how to do dynamic DNS with Cloudflare so we can talk to the bot
[ ] Create the bot, maybe directly with websockets instead of discord.js

Workshop scraper:
[x] Implement workshop scraper + downloader as microservice (bluebird)
[ ] Implement driver that mirrors the bluebird downloader onto either an IPFS instance or just regular caddy
[ ] (IPFS is really cool though hmmm)
[ ] Generate download links using Cloudflare's IPFS gateway, not ours

3rd option:
[ ] Some third option that isn't associated with Discord or Steam
[ ] Maybe just email? An email option would probably involve:
    - [ ] Set up email forwarding so postmaster, etc. still go to mailbox
    - [ ] But a special email (submit@rhythm.cafe) goes to the server directly
    - [ ] And if there is an rdzip attachment, we add that to the database
    - [ ] Could add extremely simple captcha (i.e. "include the phrase xxxxx in your email")
